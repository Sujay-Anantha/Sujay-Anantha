# 👋 Hey there, I'm Sujay Anantha!

🎓 Master of Computer Engineering from NYU Tandon, where I juggled bytes and bits to tame the wild beasts known as data and software.

## 📍 New Yorker at Heart
Living in the city that never sleeps, I engineer dreams during the day and code them into reality by night. From crunching data to crafting algorithms that solve real-world problems, I'm all about turning the impossible into the I'm-possible.

## 🚀 What I Do
I blend the art of data analytics with the science of software engineering to create innovative solutions that make machines smarter and lives easier. Whether it’s through Python scripts that dance to the tune of data or Java applications that run as smooth as a New York cheesecake, I’m your guy!

### 💾 Tech Stack:
- **Languages:** Python 🐍, Java ☕, C++
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Pytorch
- **Tools:** SQL, MATLAB, JavaScript, MongoDB, Azure, NoSQL, Oracle Data Modeler, Hive, Apache, Tableau, Hadoop, MySQL, Keras, NumPy, GNNs, CNNs, NLP tools like Hugging Face & NLTK
- **OS:** Windows, Linux
- **I also speak:** Excel and PowerPoint

## 📊 Data Wizard
I turn coffee into code and data into decisions. Got a data puzzle? Throw it my way, and watch it get solved faster than you can say "Neural Network".

## 🤝 Let's Connect
If you're looking to blend innovative coding with impactful insights, I'm your collaborator. Let’s power up our projects with code and coffee! Drop a 📧 at sujay.anantha@nyu.edu or connect with me here on GitHub. 

## 📈 Beyond Code
When not coding, I’m probably...
- 🏋️‍♂️ Hitting the gym
- 📚 Reading the latest in tech and science fiction
- 🌍 Traveling and coding from new locations

`"Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad."` – Feel free to explore my repositories and let's get those digital laughs rolling!
